# gaussian-bayesian-optimize
Summer 2019 internship:
Active learning code using Gaussian fit and Bayesian optimization to optimize 2-column data inputs
Specifically for materials science application

Can input 2-column data (say, iron percentage and copper percentage in alloy)
Will return optimum point (intersection)

Can return "goodness" tests of root mean squared error or minimum regret
